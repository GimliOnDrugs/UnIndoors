## Testing
The following procedure must be repeated in order to make sure every functionality of the system works as expected.
The main idea behind that is the application can be access as student and operator.

### Student
1. Open the homepage and through the navbar click on 'Sign up'
2. Create a new account @gmail
3. Through the navbar click on 'Log In' and log in using username and password previously registered
4. After the login you'll be redirected to the classes page, where the scheduling of lessons is given. Make sure each class has hour, teacher, place.
5. Open a request for help to an operator. Check the badge under the title that should indicate how many operators are currently available.
6. When openining a detailed class you should be able to check the status of your open request (pending, accepted, refused). You should even be able to send a message to an operator and receive an answer as well.
7. You must see all the places with lessons. 
8. After a succesful login, the navbar text should change from 'Log In' to 'Log Out'.


### Operator
1. Open the homepage and through the navbar click on 'Sign up'
2. Create a new account @operatore
3. Through the navbar click on 'Log In' and log in using username and password previously registered.
4. After the login, the text 'Log In' placed in the navbar should change into 'Log Out'.
5. After the login, as operator, you'll be redirected to the page where you can see all the requests. Here, test if the filter works correctly and if the badge placed under the title indicates the correct number of pending requests. Now, accept a pending request previously open as student. Insert a message as a reply.
6. After a request is taken in charge (accepted or refused) the button should be disabled.
